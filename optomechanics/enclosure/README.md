Designed for laser safety and blacking out emissions pathway for a custom microscopy setup. These posts have slots for ~2.5-mm thick panels, are 180 mm tall, and have holes with clearance for M6 screws and matching hole spacing on 25-mm gridded optical tables.

The larger model has 3-mm slots with rolled edges. The thinner model is an earlier prototype with 2.5-mm slots that might be easier to modify.
